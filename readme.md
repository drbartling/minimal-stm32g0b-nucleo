# minimal-stm32g0b-nucleo

A minimal project for a STM32G0B1 on a nucleo board

## About the project

There's a few minimal-stm style projects on github, so why make another?  I wanted to try and make the code a little more human readable.

It comes up a lot that engineers from adjacent fields are intimidated by linker scripts assembly, etc.  And a lot of it comes down to the fact that a lot of the linker scritpps we work with are generated by machines to be interpreted by machines.  Some thing goes for the start-up code that runs before main.

I wanted to make these things a little more human readable.
